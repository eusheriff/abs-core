# ABS Core Launch Plan 🚀

**Goal**: Establish ABS Core as the de-facto standard for "Safe Autonomous Business Agents" by Q2 2026.

## 🎯 Value Proposition
- **Primary**: "The Immune System for AI Agents."
- **Differentiator**: Immutable Decision Log *before* execution (preventive vs reactive).
- **Target Audience**: Startups/Enterprises building agentic workflows (fintech, support, e-commerce) who fear LLM hallucinations.

- **"The Log"**: Scrolling through a granular forensic trace showing latency breakdown.

### 2. Social Content
- **Announcement Post**: "Introducing ABS Core v2.0: Stop fearing your agents."
- **Deep Dive Thread**: "Why we chose SQLite on the Edge for Agent Memory."

### 3. Community
