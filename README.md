# ABS Kernel (formerly ABS Core)

> **The Immune System for AI Agents.**
>
> **Governance Runtime** that prevents LLMs from executing dangerous actions.
> Start with visibility (**Scanner**), upgrade to control (**Enforcement**).

## 🔍 What is ABS Kernel?

> **Validates Antigravity Strategy**: Compatible with **Secure Mode** (v1.11+) and **Agent Skills** (v1.14+). See [Strategy](docs/_consolidated/STRATEGY_ANTIGRAVITY.md).

ABS Kernel defines **how agents can exist** without executing them. It acts as a **Cognitive Host Interface (CHI)** between your AI Agent (Cursor, Windsurf, LangChain) and the operating system.

- **🛡️ Intercept**: Analyzes every tool call, file write, and network request.
- **🧠 Decide**: Evaluates actions against **Cognition Profiles** and policies.
- **📝 Evidence**: Logs tamper-proof audit trails (WAL) with cryptographic integrity.

### The "ABS Triangle"

1. **Governance (Kernel)**: The immutable engine that enforces rules.
2. **Cognition Interface (CHI)**: Analysis layer that understands intent (e.g., "recursive delete detected").
3. **Layers (Profile/Workspace)**: Trust hierarchy separating user config from kernel logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install ABS CLI
 
#### Via Homebrew (Recommended for Mac)
 
```bash
brew install --build-from-source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eusheriff/abs-core/main/homebrew/abs.rb
```

 
#### Via NPM (Run once)

```bash
npx @oconnector/abs-scan
```

Or install the CLI globally (no shims):

```bash
npm install -g @oconnector/abs-cli
```


### 2. Configure a Policy (Profile Layer)

Create `~/.abs/profile.yaml` to define your safety boundaries:

```yaml
# ~/.abs/profile.yaml
abs_profile:
  version: "1.0"
  preferences:
    default_risk_threshold: medium
    require_approval_for_delete: true
  capabilities:
    can_disable_safe_mode: false
```

### 3. Run a Scan (Visibility)

Check your project for policy violations before the agent runs:

```bash
abs scan --path ./src
```

### 4. Enforcement (Runtime Protection)

When integrated via the VS Code Extension or SDK, ABS blocks dangerous actions:

> **Agent**: "I will delete all files in /tmp"
>
> **ABS**: `DENY` (Rule: `fs.delete:**/*` requires approval)
>
> **Logs**: Saved to `WORKLOG.wal` with HMAC signature.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Core vs. Profile

To maintain security while allowing personalization, ABS uses **Layer Separation** (ADR-005):

| **Layer** | **Owner** | **Role** | **Trust Level** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kernel** | ABS | Immutable governance engine | Absolute |
| **Profile** | User/Org | Global preferences rules | Semi-Trusted |
| **Workspace** | Project | Project-specific overrides | Untrusted |
| **Input** | Agent | Runtime prompts/actions | Zero Trust |

## 🛡️ Security Posture

We follow **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications**.

- **Prompt Injection**: Mitigated via CHI Introspection and Input Layer sanitization.
- **Excessive Agency**: Controlled via Whitelisting and Cognition Profiles.
- **Tampering**: All decisions are signed (HMAC-SHA256) and hash-chained.

See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
