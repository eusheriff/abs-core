The **ABS Core** project is an Open Source initiative licensed under **Apache License 2.0**. This ensures that enterprise users can modify and distribute the software with patent protection, while maintaining the freedom to use it in commercial products.

## Component Licenses

## Why Apache 2.0?

We chose Apache 2.0 to provide:
1.  **Commercial Friendliness**: You can use ABS in proprietary software.
2.  **Patent Grant**: Explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users.
3.  **Enterprise Trust**: A standard, well-understood license for critical infrastructure.
