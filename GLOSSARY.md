# Glossary & Disambiguation

## Disambiguation: What is "ABS"?

In this repository, **ABS** stands for:
> **Autonomous Business Systems**
> *A system where AI proposes decisions, but a deterministic runtime governs their execution.*

**It does NOT refer to:**
- **ABS (Satellite)**: Android Beyond the Stratosphere / Payload-oriented nano-satellite platforms.
- **ABS (Language)**: The Abstract Behavioral Specification modelling language (abs-models.org).
- **ABs (Transport)**: Autonomous Buses/Minibuses.
- **ABS (Math)**: Absolute Value.
- **ABS (Plastics)**: Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene.

We use the term strictly in the context of **Enterprise AI Governance**.

## Core Terminology

### Decision Integrity
The guarantee that every action taken by the system can be traced back to a specific PROPOSAL (LLM) and AUTHORIZATION (Policy), recorded in an immutable log *before* execution.

### Policy Gate
A deterministic code block (TypeScript/Policy) that evaluates a structured proposal. It returns strictly `ALLOW` or `DENY`. It cannot be hallucinated.

### Excessive Agency
A vulnerability where an AI agent has more autonomy or permissions than necessary, potentially leading to unintended damage (OWASP LLM08). `abs-core` is designed to mitigate this.

### Proposal
A structured JSON object generated by the LLM, representing an *intention* to act. It is not an action until signed by the Policy Gate.

### Reference Runtime
This codebase is a reference implementation of the Decision Integrity pattern. Ideally, you should fork or import it to build your own governed agents.
